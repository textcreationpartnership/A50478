            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Even <hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> fulfil'd the determinate counſel of God.

Moreover, ſuch is Gods gracious and merciful nature, that we may be aſſured he is not delighted in his Creatures ſufferings, which he never inflicts but for ſome juſt and weighty cauſe; yea, I may ſay, which they ſcarce ever undergo, but when they fooliſhly and wilfully pluck them upon their own heads.

Yet miſtake me not, as if I thought that they who ſuffer moſt are the greateſt ſinners, and that the City was ſo much more wicked than the Country, as its ſufferings are greater: But only this I dare ſafely ſay, that Sin is the great Incendiary of our Land, the Traytor and Deſtroyer that hath done us ſo much miſchief, even the ſins of all, and therefore hath a Judgement beſaln us, wherein there are few but are concern'd, either for themſelves or relations, or at leaſtwiſe, as members of that Commonalty which ſuffers ſo greatly: and thoſe particular perſons upon whom it hath faln heavieſt, though there may be many that have deſerved as ill, who perhaps fare better than they, yet have they no reaſon to think that they have far'd worſe than they deſerv'd.

I know not what can bee objected, but that common pretence, <hi>That this is the way to caſt us all into confuſions and diſorders:</hi> To which I have before ſufficiently anſwered. Why, I beſeech you, ſhould acts of Clemency breed Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where thoſe of rigour have been receiv'd with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Why ſhould they be thought ſo fooliſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous, as to become diſorderly by the favour of their ſuperiours, who have had ſo much Conſcience, as to be peaceable in the want of it? Eſpecially ſince this favour is of that nature, that it makes them little more capable of doing miſchief, if they were inclined to it, but might do much to prevent or take away ſuch incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, if there was any danger. And how can that breed Confuſion, which will do ſo much to the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mindes, the uniting of hearts, and ſo to the ſtrengthening of our hands. But to ſecure all, what can be deſired more than is before intimated? <hi>viz.</hi> That they who ſhare in this Liberty, binde themſelves by the moſt plain and ſacred Oaths, not to endeavour the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of either Church or State, but the peace of both. And if any bee indeed found guilty of acting to the contrary, let them bear the puniſhments due to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Perjury.</p>
            <p>Fain now would I hope that there are none ſo fully bent on their own Wills, that they are abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, no offered Reaſons nor Entreaties ſhall prevail with them, to depart an inch from their undertaken courſe. Let us leave that as a property of the moſt ſingular Church, amongſt the many other Prerogatives which makes her ſtand by her ſelf, to juſtifie and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all her Errours, leaſt ſhe ſhould be thought once to have err'd; Proclaiming her Obſtinacy, inſtead of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving her Fallibility.

It is not my buſineſs now to enquire into the nature of thoſe things wherein we differ, ſo to attempt a diciſion, who is in the right, and who is in the wrong; and thence to infer the equitableneſs of Liberty to any ſort of men, upon ſuppoſition of their being in the right: But it is enough for my deſign to ſuppoſe (what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſhould not, by any that are ſober and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, be denied me, to wit.)</p>

But that I may not ſeem to aggravate your grief, and bring you nothing but ſad tidings, know, though I cannot ſpeak a word of comfort to you whilſt you continue in your preſent carnal ſtate, yet would you but make haſte out of the ſame, there is great Mercy before you, and a way open for your acceſs to that Grace whence you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an abundant ſupply for all your wants, and true joy in the midſt of your troubles.

When once you have got your hearts in heaven, you have got a treaſure there: Whatever other duties are required of you, will be found natural and eaſie, when you are but principled with a prevailing, deep-rooted love of heavenlie things. And one would think it no hard thing to attain ſuch holie affections, if firſt you will but well and dulie conſider the worthleſueſs of all things elſe, till you are cur'd of your exceſſive and undeſerved admiration of them; and then will be as much in meditation of the excellencie, the ſuitableneſs, the ſufficiencie of thoſe things that are inviſible and eternal; and how great reaſon you have, and what engagements you lie under to fix and ſettle your hearts upon them. Conſider well what you owe to the giver and preſerver of your life, and all the comforts of it, and how you ought to ſtand affected toward him who thought not his own unvaluable Bloud too good to be ſhed for ſuch finners as we. Think, if you have ſuch

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63182:39"/>and all manner of bodily accommodations, are no farther to be reckoned good for a man, than as they help on his higher ſpiritual good, as by them we are ſupported whil'ſt wee are ſerving God, and as wee emploie them to his Glorie, by putting them to thoſe ſeveral good uſes which he hath appointed us. By this time, I hope, you apprehend what it is I drive at, namelie, to manifeſt how inconſiderable your loſſes are, that you may value them accordinglie. You ſee of what nature, and in what rank thoſe things are which you have parted with, at what a great diſtance they ſtand from your happineſs, and how little reference they have thereto: And that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you conſider your happineſs as now begun, or as you are in the way to it hereafter to be enjoied. If e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven here on earth, the good man who lives in the fear and love of his Maker, bee the only happie man, what then are you the unhappier for having loſt ſome, yet, ſuppoſe it were all of thoſe worldly things you poſſeſt?

And the better yet to clear and ſettle your apprehenſions, I would deſire you but attentlie to conſider your own Nature, whether you bear not ſomething about you better than fleſh and blood, and whether the gratifying and advancing of this Nobleſt part be not moſt your intereſt; and how far earthlie things, which are of a nature ſo diſtant from it, can be ſerviceable to this end? Confider moreover, what that is which you muſt live upon for ever, and then think whether ſuch kind of attainments as make the neareſt approach thereto, and are the very beginning of it, ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ot rather to be ſtil'd your happineſs, than ſuch as are quite of another kind, and will then be whollie uſeleſs. Conſider alſo what kind of men they are to whom ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narilie the largeſt ſhare of theſe things is allotted; how Infidels, Idolaters, and the profaneſt wretches abound therewith; and remember how little of them Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his moſt Nobleſt Followers enjoyed; and yet bear what <hi>Paul</hi> in the name of the reſt tells us, That whilſt they were as poor, they made many rich; whilſt they ſeemed to have nothing, they poſſeſt all things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. Think what were the <hi>riches</hi> they conferr'd, and what were the <hi>all things</hi> they poſſeſt, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they confirm not what I have ſaid. Furthermore, obſerve what language Scripture gives to theſe things, as they would be any part of mans felicity, and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard it commands us to have for them.

Lay but all theſe conſiderations together, which for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie ſake I only mention, and argue thence how little of true happineſs conſiſts in the having of them, and how little hurt is done, and therefore how little cauſe of mourning given by their removal.</p>
            <p>And let me farther add, as very Notions as theſe may ſeem, whoever he be that is not ſo thorowlie perſwaded of their truth as to frame his apprehenſions, and regulate his affections conformablie thereto, is never ordinarilie like to live any other than an unquiet, diſcontented, and therefore miſerable life, be it little or much that be hath. 'Tis a moſt true ſaying of an excellent Heather. Moraliſt, that there are puniſhments, as it were, by an irreverſible Law, appointed for thoſe, who in a conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Divine Order and eſtabliſhment of things, conceive too great an Opinion and love for any worldly matters, which puniſhments ariſe out of the very bowels of their vicious affections. For ſuch (ſaith he) ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, covetous flatterers; they ſhall be caſt into inward, diſturbances, and break out into womaniſh lamentari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And was it needful, I might ſhew by many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of ſome of the moſt rational and ſober Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that they by the very light of Nature and ſtrength of reaſon, diſcovered as much as I have aſſerted, that Humane Felicity depends not upon things external: Though I confeſs few of them (ſo far as I can learn) could tell much of our future perfect happineſs, and therefore wanted ſufficient Motives to recommend a contempt of the world, and the like difficult duties to their hearers: This they left for Chriſtianity to do, which hath fully done it, revealing to us a ſtate of Eternal Bliſs purchaſt by Jeſus Chriſt for all his faithful ſervants whence I may afterward particularly fetch ground <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Need I bid you remember that your money is no currant Coin in the other world, nor would beſlead you any thing there. The Judicature erected in the Heavens admits neither of bribes nor fees.

And if all this be ſo (as there is nothing more certain) how little reaſon have you to judge your ſelves in a worſe ſtate than formerly, or to grieve as if you were ſo?

In that you may ſtill purſue the great buſineſs of your lives as advantageouſly as ever, and carry on all your deſigns upon the Coeleſtial Kingdome with as good ſucceſs. If indeed you had been ſent into the world to gather wealth, and leave it to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; that you might raiſe great families which ſhould flouriſh when you were dead and gone, you had now been ſadly caſt back, and little better than quite broke; and 'tis no wonder if they take themſelves to be ſo who made this their chief end. But if your buſineſs here be, to glorifie and pleaſe him that created and redeemed you, by an holy fruitful converſation, and to get your ſouls prepar'd for an higher bliſs, (which I hope you que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not but it is) then, I ſay, you may follow it on with as much courage, and to as good purpoſe, as ever former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you did, without check or hindrance by this or any the like diſaſter. Now what a ridiculous thing would it be accounted, for a General to be daunted for the loſs of a few ſtragling Souldiers, whilſt the Main Body of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and all things neceſſary to carry on the War, are ſtill ſecure? Or for a Marriner to ſtand weeping for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Ship ſomewhat weather-beaten and defac't, as to its painting and fineneſs, whilſt it's ſtill as ſufficient and well-fitted for his Voyage as before? Or for a rich Merchant to lament ſome ſuch trivial loſs as is ſcarce miſt out of his ſtock, nor is any hindrance to his great Trading? Why then ſhould the ſincere Chriſtian be ſo deeply affected with thoſe occurrences which need be no let to him in his journey, and which leave him never the leſs capable of mannaging his chiefeſt Trade for inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble durable riches? So that, I hope, I have clear'd the truth of my Poſition, paſt all denial or doubting, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63182:44"/>have made it to appear, that you have receiv'd no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable diſadvantage by any effects of the Fire; and therefore it is a very reaſonable exhortation, that your ſorrow ſhould bear proportion to the ground of it, and not be exceſſive, when you have no cauſe, nor can ſhew any reaſon, why it ſhould be ſo.</p>

Surely all are not Children and Fools, to mourn for the loſing of Pins or Counters, wherefore, how can we but think the things they loſe of more worth than ſo, except we will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the generality of men of extream Childiſhneſſe and F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If this ſtick any thing with you, for your ſatisfaction, I would in one word adviſe you, ſoberly to conſider all that hath been ſaid, to evince how very little, or juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, a great eſtate contributes to the happineſs of man; and if you can indeed make it out to your own impartial thoughts, that this aſſertion is falſe, and the arguments brought to prove it fallacious, and can manifeſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by ſtronger reaſons, you ſhall have my free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to reject it: But if you are not able to do thus, not can rationally contradict the former diſcourſe, judge your ſelves, whether the example even of the moſt, of the greateſt, or of thoſe whom the world count the wiſeſt, ought to weaken your aſſent to a plain, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable truth.

               </gap> God himſelf, the Profeſſions of all Chriſtians, the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Reaſon, and the Writings of wiſeſt Heathens will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63182:44"/>well warrant, and the convictions of almoſt all, one time or other, yield a ſuffrage to: What then have we to do with the examples of frail men, under the power of their paſſions, how many ſoever they be? May I not with as much reaſon demand, If it be true what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies of the vanity of all the worldlings Idols; and what <hi>David</hi> ſaies, that men <hi>diſquiet themſelves in vain, whil'ſt they are heaping up riches;</hi> and what a greater than either, even our Lord himſelf, tells us, <hi>That our life conſiſts not in the abundance of thoſe things which we poſſeſs;</hi> how then it comes to paſs, that the moſt are ſo eager and inſatiable in their deſires after them, ſo conſtant and unwearied in their labours to attain them? Is this becauſe God and good men ſpeak worſe of the world than it deſerves? Or becauſe the moſt are careleſs and inconſiderate, and think better of it than it is, purſuing the common courſe, without examining the reaſon, or foreſeeing the end of it? and ſo in a blinde zeal, making that their Idol which they ſee ſo many adore; they follow it with the ſame care and love, as if it was indeed their God and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: which I know you'l grant to bee a very groſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; And yet, as bad as it is, from this very ſame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, proceeds that unſeemly and exceſſive ſorrow, which you behold in thoſe from whom the things of the world are withdrawn. Whil'ſt they kept them, they let out their hearts upon, and rejoyc't in them, and even bleſt themſelves in their enjoyment of them, as if they would abide with them, and make them happy for ever: How then can it otherwiſe bee, but that when they are remov'd, they ſhould wring their hands and tear their hearts with grief, as being depriv'd of that in the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof they took all the ſatisfaction and joy they had, and from which they had expectations of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than ever yet they had found? Who, that is of theſe carnal principles, can poſſibly bear up under
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63182:45"/>the interruption of this comfort, the fruſtration of theſe hopes? Yet this weak carriage of theirs, tells us not what the worth of the world was, but what kinde of falſe apprehenſions they had of it, and how great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance they had upon it. Though it bee but an Idol that's carried away, yet if <hi>Micah</hi> have taken it for his God, what wonder if he follow after the men who ſpoil him of it, with a deal of lamentation and noiſe, from which he would never ceaſe, but that <hi>he perceives they are too ſtrong for him, Judge</hi> 18.24, 26. Even theſe are ſome of thoſe <hi>ſorrows</hi> with which, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>they that covet after money, do pierce themſelves thorough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps you'l tell me, that not only the covetous who are Idolaters, but even good men themſelves ſeem very unable to bear the loſing or leſſening of their eſtates, and are more concern'd for them, than if they were of no greater value than I ſpeak of, and therefore hence you conclude, that it's warrantable, or however una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, to have a deeper ſenſe of their departure than I ſeem to allow.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) It is not the example of men, what ever they be, but the Word of God, that muſt bee your direction and rule to guide you in all your apprehenſions and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: And you know well enough what this tells you of the World, and how you ought to ſtand affected to it, whether it ſmile or frown; that you ſhould not, <hi>when riches encreaſe, ſet your hearts upon them,</hi> leaſt when they waſte, your comfort ſhould do ſo too.

            <p>There are indeed (to digreſs a little) many ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent leſſons taught by this diſpenſation, that to him who ſoberly and attentively obſerves the ſame, it may prove a moſt profitable Sermon.

He that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his capacity, layes out his eſtate for God (or keeps it principally to trade with for him) is that wiſe Merchant, who puts it into ſuch hands, where not only the principal is ſecur'd, but an intereſt of another value, than blinde earth worms are acquainted with, is certain to be gain'd.</p>
            <p>What one ſaith of <hi>Job,</hi> may be partly applied to your caſe, that he had loſt all but what he had given away. That which hath fed and cloth'd the poor Members of Chriſt, or any other way been emploied for his ſervice, is ſtill your own, and to bee reckoned as good as ready money, and better too; if there be any truth in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which, I preſume, you queſtion not. And for your own gain and comfort, I heartily wiſh, that your expences for Chriſt, amounted to a greater ſum, than an Inventory of your loſſes by the Fire does; then, though you had nothing to ſhew but the very clothes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your backs, I durſt confidently affirm, you have more than you have loſt. And hence, for the future, you may take direction how to improve and ſecure what wealth God ſhall entruſt you with, and may be taught the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, ſtill to take the firſt opportunity to that end. The words of our Saviour to <hi>Judas,</hi> which the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles thought had a reference to his giving ſomething to the poor, may very well be applied to that purpoſe, <hi>That thou diſt, do it quick'y.</hi> In <hi>good works,</hi> you may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, <hi>make heſte to bee rich.</hi> Nay here, if in any thing, delay is dangerous. Not without reaſon doth the Wiſe man exhort us to <hi>do good, whil'ſt it is in the power of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63182:52"/>our hand, and not bid our Neighbour come again to morrow, when we have it by us. Prov.</hi> 3.27, 28. That which is to day in your hands, and may bee profitable to your ſelf and brother, may to morrow be ſnatcht out of them, and neither of you bee the better for it. Wherefore learn wiſdome by what you have ſeen: You eſpecially that have but ſeen, not at all, or but little felt the effects of this Fire, let your <hi>bounty</hi> to your impoveriſht brethren, be your <hi>thank-offering</hi> to God for your preſervation. And let all take notice, that if they are ſo backward to render God his own, in that way that it may bee moſt theirs, he can ſend for it in ſuch waies as will bee little for their advantage. Is it not better, think you, to ſend up your treaſures to Heaven voluntarilie, where you may finde-them hereafter, than to have them go up thither wards in clouds of ſmoak, never more to beſtead you? And it will make but little to your commendation or comfort, to have your eſtates fetcht away in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by hundreds and thouſands, which before were wont to be ſqueez'd from you for good uſes, onlie by ſixpences and ſhillings.</p>
            <p>But to return, the great leſſon which is preſt upon you hence, and which indeed is underſtood in all theſe, is what I before intimated, namelie, how very unfit any thing which the whole affords, is, to be your felicitie and portion; and how unreaſonable it is that you ſhould have the leaſt regard to it as ſuch. And by the palpable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of its vanitie, which the Providence of God hath made before your eies, you may, through his Grace working with your ſerious conſideration, be brought off from all ſuch inordinate regard to it, which the beſt are too ſubject to. Now without queſtion to have this ſo common and dangerous a diſeaſe weakned and removed, is a far greater mercie than to have had all that is gone from you reſerv'd. Nay, this might have prov'd a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63182:53"/>of your miſery, to have retain'd that which gave ſtrength to your diſeaſe. For examine it well, and tell me, whether your very enjoyments have not been a clog and hindrance to you, and made you remiſs and ſluggiſh in the way to heaven, by the flatteries and diverſions wherewith they were wont to entertain and amuſe you?</p>
            <p>Have they not ſpoil'd many a Duty, and rendred ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an Ordinance uſeleſs, through their too great prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of your hearts? Have they not been apt to fill you with falſe and carnal joyes, with a vain confidence and ſelf-conceit? Hath not the World been a bait and ſnare to your corrupt natures, and drawn you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly compliances with the guize of this luxurious, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical age? in the needleſs coſt and braverie of your attire, houſes and furniture; in the exceſs of your feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and entertainments, in a tenderneſs and delicacie that becomes not the good <hi>Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Theſe are the common effects of wealth, and the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherewith it is attended; and though the power of Grace might ſecure you from the more deadly, damning hurt of its charms, yet its too too probable ſome force they had upon you. What a mercie then may you well account it, if this fire have burnt up ſo much of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate as was hurtful to you, and ſo refin'd the reſt, that it may no more hurt you. Though it will not indeed prove you humble and mortified, becauſe you live at a meaner rate than you were wont, being neceſſitated thereto; yet this neceſſity may prove a notable means to that end, and becoming at length the matter of your choice, is capable of being improv'd into a virtue: A great deal of unneceſſary expence and ſtir to gratifie the fleſh will be ſav'd, when there remains no ſuch plenty to be laviſht away; and hereby may the man in time vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily become much more temperate, ſober, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying: Poverty may prick the Bladder of Pride which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63182:53"/>riches were ſo apt to blow up; and inſtead thereof bring in not a forc't, but true humility; yea, the very loſs of one great eſtate, may make the owners reſolve never to cover after another, not out of deſpair, but prudence, as ſeeing what their deſigns are all come to, and may do again, if they ſhould follow them as before; and ſo they may meet with contentedneſs in a low eſtate, who went without it in an higher, and may ſerve God better in want than in their former abundance.</p>
            <p>Surelie thus to take Knives or Ratsbane out of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens hands is a friendlie office, and when they come to underſtand what was done for them, they'l ſo eſteem it, though at firſt they may take on as if they were hurt.

The Phyſitian is not onlie ſubmitted to, but paid for his Phyſick, though his bitter Pills and Potions might make us ſick before they helpt us to our health? And ſhall we behave our ſelves worſe toward God, who delights not in our ſmart and ſorrow, onlie <hi>if need be,</hi> will let his deareſt ſervants meet with manifold temptations and tryals?

Thus the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, Rom.</hi> 5.3. Now a Chriſtian comes more to ſee the want of his ſpiritual armour than before he did, and therefore labours and prays for it with greater diligence and earneſtneſs. But if any man ſhould ask, whether it was not better never to have need of this, by being freed from thoſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that make it neceſſary? I may take leave to tell him, it ſavours of an impudence, unbeſeeming ſo filly a Creature as man, to call in queſtion the proceedings of his Maker, and demand whether he might not have ordered things better than he hath. Who ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the way to heaven, but he that owns both it and us, and may beſtow it upon what conditions he will? And though (if need were) it might be evident that there is great wiſdome and equity in that order which God hath eſtabliſht, yet its enough for us, that we are told it is his pleaſure, that <hi>through many tribulations we muſt enter into his Kingdome,</hi> and muſt fight before we tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, overcome before we are crown'd. And if this be his ſetled will, we may eaſily apprehend how needful faith and patience are for this preſent ſtate; and how much for our advantage that condition is, which does not only put us upon the exerciſe, but tends to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them.</p>

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, ſo diſingenuous and inconſiderate we are, as often to be drawn away into a forgetfulneſs of God, by thoſe very mercies and comforts which ſhould have made us mindful of him, and engag'd us cloſer to him, and in ſuch a caſe (which happens too frequently) by the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of thoſe we may better learn what a kind of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance that is we have alwayes upon him, and how much we have been beholden to his bounty, when we were little affected to it. It is alſo very profitable for us t obe ſometimes caſt into ſuch a plunge, whence we plainlie perceive God only can deliver us; for this will put us upon more ſollicitous enquiries after him, make us relie upon him, and that with all our weight and ſtreſs, and will help us to a clearer ſenſe of his loving kindneſs and Almightineſs, in affording us relief when all other refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges fail'd us.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63182:59"/>in whoſe hands our times are, can tell what daies you may be reſerved for, and what it may coſt you faithfully to follow the Lamb in the way that he hath led and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd you. And perhaps he ſaw you more entangled in the affairs of this life, than is fit for thoſe that have your warfare to accompliſh, and more than would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to pleaſe him whoſe Souldiers you are. The way that is yet behind for you to walk over, may be ſo rough and untrod, that whilſt you were laden with thick clay, you could not have been able to make progreſs therein, and therefore may you be rendred more light and fit for travel; the weight which preſt you down being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, even an earthlie load without you, and the greater load of carnal affections from within. In times of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for the truth, there's nothing ordinarily proves a more dangerous ſnare than a great eſtate. It had been happy, for ought I know, for the young man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, if all his poſſeſſions had been burnt before he came to Chriſt; he had then, at leaſt, wanted that temptation which made him go away ſorrowful. And as happy had it been for many another, if their riches had been ſent the ſame way, before they were call'd to loſe them for Chriſt: for then we may probably ſuppoſe, they had not forſaken him for love of this preſent world, which none are ſo apt to do, as they who have moſt in it to cleave to. In St. <hi>James</hi> his time, it was the rich men that were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors and perſecutors, whilſt the poor onlie were Confeſſors and Martyrs, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7. And ſo in all times it is uſual. How know you then but God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the world from you, leaſt in a day of trial it ſhould have drawn you away from him. Thus may the burning of your houſes enable you the better to burn at a ſtake, if ever you ſhould be call'd to'r; and ſo one <hi>Fiery Tryal</hi> would fit you for another. But though you eſcape this, yet death you cannot eſcape; and to behold in this
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63182:60"/>manner the Funeral of worldlie wealth and glorie, may very much prepare you for your own. The greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles you meet with in your journey, will they not make you long the more for your journeys end? When the Traveller finds his money fall ſhort, or himſelf tired out with the length and badneſs of his way, then he falls more heartilie to wiſhing himſelf at home: Not that you ought in one of <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Pets to take on, and deſire by all means to die preſentlie, becauſe your <hi>Gourds are withered,</hi> your flouriſhing eſtates faded away. None or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarilie are more unfit, and if the truth was known, more unwilling to die, than they who in a diſcontented mood are wiſhing themſelves dead; for it muſt be love to heaven, more than wearineſs of the earth, that can confer this fitneſs, and this willingneſs. But yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion, you may make this improvement of all the ſmart and wearineſs you feel, thereby to be ſet a longing after the promiſed eaſe and reſt. Thoſe deſires after death, which proceed from a ſerious apprehenſion of the Worlds vanity, and its unfitneſs to be your reſting place, and are bounded with a ſubmiſſion to Gods Will, are not onlie lawful, but commendable; and you may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem it a mercie to have them quickned: Perhaps whilſt your preſent ſtare was pleaſant and deſirable, you found it ſomething difficult to get heartilie willing to leave it, or to repreſent to your ſelf any other condition ſo much better, as might make you deſirous to part with this: But now, I hope, this difficultie is much abated, if not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie removed. If you found ſuch plentiful and pleaſing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in your Inne, that you began to think of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding there, and to grow forgetful of your own home, will you not be of another mind when you have met with rougher uſage? It is not <hi>Lazarus</hi> his hard fare, but <hi>Dives</hi> his dailie dainties, and ſuch like Bands of love, which chain poor creatures to the World. Moreover,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63182:60"/>it is to be conſidered, that at Death you muſt have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the ſame, and a greater trial than now you have done, in leaving that which hath now left you; and then to have found your heart ſticking to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and unwilling to bee torn from it, would have been much more grievous to you. Far ſafer it is that our Bladders ſlip from under us in the ſhallow water, where we may trie our skill with leſt hazard, than in the deep, where wee muſt either ſwim or drown. By this experience you have had of your ſelves, how you can bear the departure of the world, if you have found out your weakneſs, you are yet in a capacitie of looking out for help, and getting better provided for your laſt great encounter; or if you have diſcovered ſtrength, you may the more chearfullie expect, and boldlie addreſs your ſelves thereunto. Thus you ſee, this affliction, <hi>which at preſent ſeems not joyous but grievous, may afterwards yield the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs, to thoſe that are exerciſed therewith:</hi> And therefore it ſeems no way abſurd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the exhortation to you, which we finde, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Let the brother of high degree</hi> (not only be content, but) <hi>rejoyce that he is</hi> (thus to his advantage) <hi>made low.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides what may accrue to the ſufferers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I might (the more to engage their ſubmiſſion) men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the good that may hereby be done to others; as this ſignal Providence may tend to awaken our Land, and put us upon Repentance and Reformation; or at leaſt may quicken all that are ſerious, to do what in them lies for the promoting of this work; and may alſo be a means of terrifying ſome careleſs ſinners from their waies of wickedneſs, and of bringing them home to God. If any ſuch work as this was to be done, or a warning giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the Nation, and God ſaw fit to do it by the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Metropolis, why ſhould you not freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that your houſes ſhould go in with others, for the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63182:61"/>accompliſhment of his Will? If their deſtruction may be any means of preventing the overthrow of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; yea, or keep any poor ſoul out of eternal burning; You have no cauſe to finde fault with their being laid out ſo well. And if any one ſhould think it might have conduc't more to theſe ends, to have ſingled out the dwellings of the prophaneſt ſinners, and made them warnings to the reſt, ſparing all ſuch as feared God: They may do well to remember, that it becomes not them to preſcribe to infinite wiſdome, what waies to take for the bringing about his own deſigns; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns we are far from knowing perfectly, and leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly can we tell, what means are beſt ſuited for the compaſſing of them. But, I ſuppoſe, I have ſaid ſo much of the benefits, that may hereby be given in to true Chriſtians, as may ſufficiently demonſtrate, that this cloud, as dark as it is, hath a bright ſide ſhining upon Gods people, which may, in its kinde, do them as much ſervice, as the Pillar of Fire did to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their March: Whil'ſt they, that <hi>Aegyptian</hi>-like, are cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the miſts of wickedneſs and errour, neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit they enjoy, nor partake of it. And though ſuch blinde Atheiſts, or inconſiderate ones, may to their own hurt, miſ-conſtrue the methods of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in laſhing the good and ſparing the bad, or deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alike with both; yea, though <hi>upright men</hi> themſelves may be ſomewhat <hi>aſtonied at this, yet ſhall the innocent ſtir up himſelf againſt the Hypocrite; the righteous alſo ſhall hold on his waies, and he that hath clean hands ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger, Job</hi> 17.8, 9. And thus, I hope, ſhould I ſay no more, I have ſhewed you abundant ground for patience and quietneſs under the hand of God. Since</p>
            <p n="1">(1) It is the hand of God, who cannot wrong you, and therefore gives you no cauſe to murmur.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) This hand of God hath not hurt you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63182:61"/>gives you no cauſe to complain.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) It may greatly profit you, and ſo rather gives you cauſe to be thankful. Two or three Conſiderations more I have to ſuggeſt, which I ſhall with more brevity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch, having ſtood ſo long on theſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though your ſuffering themſelves cannot, yet <hi>your impatience under them may very much hurt you, whil'ſt on the other ſide, your patience will equally turn to your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</hi> And this may ſufficiently inſtruct you, if you have any reſpect to your own intereſt, outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which to chooſe. To purſue this in a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or two.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) By quarrelling with Gods Will in his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>you add ſin to your afflictions,</hi> and thereby put a ſting into them, that may do you that miſchief, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they never could. What think you is a ſin, if this be not, to be diſcontent with any thing which God ſhall do with you? Do you not ſeem ſo far to accuſe him of want, either of wiſdome, faithfulneſs, or goodneſs, and ſo of want of fitneſs and right to bee your Governour? And what's this, but to deſire that your affairs were in your own hands, as if then you could order them better? And have you not reaſon to ſuppreſs the very firſt motions which have ſo much wickedneſs, rebellion, and little leſs than blaſphemie in them? You may remember here, what I have formerly ſaid, to demonſtrate that ſin is the greateſt miſchief that can light upon the ſoul of man. If to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Divine Will, in all expreſſions of it, be his only intereſt, then to reſiſt this Will, muſt needs be his greateſt miſery? Verily, there is no ſuch a deformed monſtrous ſight in the whole world, as to behold a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture riſing up againſt his Maker, and entring into a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn war with Heaven it ſelf; whether it be in violating his gracious precepts, or repining at his wiſe providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And the very howling of Wolves, or croaking of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63182:62"/>Toads, is a thouſand times more acceptable noiſe, than to hear men complain and ſpeak ill of the bleſſed and good God, or any of his waies: For their noiſe, be it never ſo harſh, is natural to them; but this harſher voice of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, is moſt unnatural, and a very breaking of the <hi>harmony</hi> of the Creation, which conſiſts in a ſweet and chearful obedience of all creatures to him, from whom they receiv'd their beings, faculties, conditions, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; and in their conſtant celebrations of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, according to their ſeveral capacities. Is not the dumb meekneſs of a Lamb more grateful to all men, than the roarings and ſtrivings of a Swine? Eſpecially when kindneſs, rather than violence, is offered to us, however our falſe opinions repreſent it. Want of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may excuſe the ſtruglings of a Bruit, when you go to pluck a Thorn out of his foot, or do him any the like courteſie; but ſuch bruitiſhneſs in a Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is inexcuſable! Believe it, Sirs, ſuch unſeemly carriage as this, is infinitely worſe in the thing it ſelf, and more diſgraceful to you in the eyes of God and good men, than your loſing all the monie and goods you had in the world: This meanneſs of ſpirit, is another kinde of unhappineſs and diſhonour, than any other povertie. But on the contrarie, to bear up under Gods hand with patience and courage, is a greater commendation and priviledge, than to abound in all riches. Whatever the world may think, it is undoubtedly true, that to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the will of God under any ſuffering, is a greater bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, than to have been ſecured from that ſuffering.</hi> To bee content with ſickneſs as it comes from God, is a greater mercie than to bee in health; and ſo patience under all your loſſes, is a greater happineſs than to have loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: For the worſt of men may partake of theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral favours; but good men only are enricht with ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a ſpirit. This tried and approved Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63182:62"/>
               <hi>are much more precious than the Gold that is tryed</hi> (or than all that you have loſt) <hi>by the fire.</hi> How worthie and commendable a thing is it, for a Chriſtian in the loweſt, pooreſt, and moſt afflicted ſtate, ſtill to think and ſpeak as well and honourablie of God, who hath brought him into it, as ever before he was wont? To Apologize for that Providence which hee ſmarts under, and to let Spectators know, that hee diſcerns ſo much equitie and mercie in it, that he cannot chuſe but ſubmit thereto? Might you not hereby do more to vindicate God before the world, than any other, by bare diſcourſing can? And by your practice might condemn and ſhame all thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlie ones that act contrarilie; and may convince themſelves and others, that it is from the weakneſs of their Faith, the falſeneſs of their opinions, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs of their paſſions, that they keep ſuch a complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not from any real cauſe that God hath given them. This you may teach them more effectually than another out of your condition can: For they are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apt to reply to ſuch a one, <hi>If you was in my caſe, you would be as bad your ſelf;</hi> but when they ſee one in the like caſe, whoſe carriage is ſo unlike theirs, they will the ſooner bee put to ſilence, and ſet upon imitation of it. And would not this, do you think, very much endear you to God, to behold in you ſuch a love for himſelf, ſuch a liking of his actions, and ſuch a zeal for his honour? How do we finde him, as it were, glorying of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of his Champion <hi>Job,</hi> to Satan his Accuſer, in that he held faſt his integrity, although his eſtate was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. And does not both God and Satan now look upon <hi>you,</hi> to obſerve how you will behave your ſelves? and will it not pleaſe and glorifie God, vex and confound Satan, to behold your carriage, like that holy mans? How acceptable, alſo, will it bee to the Lord Jeſus, to ſee you tranſcribe the copy he ſet you, <hi>to walk as he walk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63182:63"/>under all the ſufferings he met with in it? And if the eye of the Prince, or General, will infuſe valour into the ſoul of the verieſt Coward, ſhall it not animate and raiſe your ſpirits, to remember what Spectators you have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Inhabitants of this lower world? Even God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and Chriſt, and all the holy Angels. You need not ſure bee told, how much you are concern'd to gain the good liking of theſe, and how much weight there is in their approbation; nor on the other ſide, how fad and ſhameful it would bee for you, to have all theſe aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of you, for your Cowardize and fainting.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Beſide the hurt that comes to your inward man, <hi>you will finde no benefit to your outward concerns, by froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impatience.</hi> He that tumbles and ſtrives, <hi>like a wilde Bull in a net,</hi> will never the ſooner diſ-entangle himſelf. There's nothing to bee gotten of God by this courſe. He that ſpar'd not his Rod, though hee knew it might diſpleaſe you, will not take it off meerly becauſe you are not pleas'd with it. Wiſe Parents, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo tender, uſe not to have regard to all the fooliſh paſſions and deſires of their Children: and as little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there, that God ſhould give heed to yours: For are they any better than childiſh, whileſt the great ground of them (to give no other proof) is, that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are periſhing and tranſitory; or, that according to their nature, they are paſt away from you. Now what weakneſs would you account it, for any man to ſit weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a beautiful Flower, becauſe it withers in his hand, and becauſe the winter-cold will not permit him to have his fair Tulips and ſweet Roſes? Or to afflict himſelf, becauſe the Moon waxes and wanes, and will not alwaies abide in the Full? What relief would you have given to this fond mourner? Should the ſeaſons of the year, or the courſe of nature be alter'd to gratifie his humour? And do you not know that there are <hi>changes</hi> in Sublunary things, as well as in the Moon? Seaſons
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63182:63"/>and Viciſſitudes in our condition, as well as in the year? And both proceed from the ſame wiſdome, though they appear not alike regular and conſtant. There is a Day and Night, a Winter and Summer, of proſperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity (I ſpeak of things without us.) And of theſe we may ſay, as the Plaſmiſt of the other, ſpeaking to God; <hi>The day is thine, the night alſo is thine: Thou hoſt made ſummer and winter, Pſal.</hi> 74.16, 17. And is there any reaſon that he ſhould alter the ſeaſons, and change the nature of things, or the courſe of his providence, for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of every man that is not pleaſed with it? Or if this ſhould ſeem too notional, you may eaſily apprehend, that peeviſhneſs and ſtubborneſs, may provoke God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to continue, than ceaſe from laſhing you. 'Tis no diſcretion in a Patent, to ſpare the Rod alwaies when the Childe cries, (the Wiſe man adviſes the contrary) much leſs to diſmiſſe him whil'ſt he is ſtomachful: And why ſhould you think the <hi>Father of Spirits</hi> will leave you, till he hath brought you into better ſubjection to him? It ſeems by your carriage, there is much corruption left in the Soul to be drawn out: and the ſame mercy that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a Corraſive becauſe it was needful, is like to hold it on whilſt it is ſo. But when the cure is wrought, when patience hath had its perfect work within you, you are nearer to a freedome from that, which hath been the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of your patience. When the Childe is brought to kiſs the Rod, the Father is wont to lay it down. When you can heartily ſay to God, <hi>Thy Will bee done,</hi> you are liklieſt to hear from him, <hi>Be it to thee as thou wilt.</hi> For they hold creature-comforts faſteſt, who ſit looſeſt from them; they deſerve them beſt, and are in the leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being hurt by them. <hi>To humble our ſelves under the mighty hand of God,</hi> is a ſure way, <hi>in his due time to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.6. <hi>You have heard of the patience of Job, and ſeen the end of the Lord, that hee is very pitiful and of

A Sword, which hee findes ſticking in his Clothes, hee madly thruſts forward, and therewith ſtabs himſelf to the heart. A Spider, which was faln into his Cup, whence it might have been gently taken without any hurt, hee ſqueezes and ſwallows down, to poiſon himſelf, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, therewith. How elſe could it be, that mens loſing of their eſtates, ſhould make them loſe their wits too? Sure there's no ſuch connexion betwixt their mony and their reaſon, that they muſt ſtand and fall together. But the buſineſs is, they fit poring upon their troubles, and repreſenting them to themſelves ſo dreadfully, till their ſpirits are overwhelmed, and their brains weakned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:

Now though I hope none that fear God, are capable of ſuch exorbitancies of paſſion, yet let them beware of the firſt riſings and bublings up thereof in the ſoul, leaſt they ſhould ſwell to a boiſterous Sea, whoſe waves they will difficultly repreſs and calm.

By <hi>patience</hi> wee do truly <hi>poſſeſs our ſouls,</hi> and enjoy our ſelves, and may feel little alteration within, whatever is done without us. Though I will not ſay it's an eaſier thing, to riſe up to this quiet, humble frame, than to fall into the contrary, yet I may well ſay, it's much more for the eaſe of the Soul, when attain'd to; ſo much more as will abundantly recompence all the pains taken in the getting of it, and may well ſet men upon diligence to that purpoſe: Eſpecially if we conſider what was ſaid before, that this is the neareſt and ſureſt way to deliverance. And if it be ſo, an eaſie way I am ſure it is: What's this, but <hi>ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord?</hi> Or as the Prophet to the <hi>Jews, In returning and reſt ſhall ye be ſaved, in quietneſs and confidence ſhall be your ſtrength. Iſa.</hi> 30.15. Or if the outward afflictions ſhould ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main upon you, yet there is in ſome ſenſe, <hi>a way made to eſcape,</hi> whilſt you are thus <hi>made able to bear it,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Conſider how by your unſeemly dejection under the hand of God, <hi>you may do very much to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> which you profeſs heartily to believe and love. What will the Atheiſt, or what will the prophane ſcoffer ſay, when they ſhall ſee this? So
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63182:65"/>ſottiſh and malicious they are, that if they do but ſee you in affliction, they are ſtraightway ſcornfully demanding, <hi>Where is now their God?</hi> But what will they ſay, if they ſhould hear you your ſelves unbelievingly cry out, <hi>Where is our God?</hi> Will they not be ready to cry, <hi>This is the Religion they make ſuch boaſt of, which you ſee how little it does for them in a day of extremity: They talkt of promiſer, rich and precious promiſes, but where are they now? Or t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> what purpoſe do they ſerve? They ſaid they had a treaſure in Heaven, what ails them mourn ſo then, if their riches bee there?</hi> And carnal worldlings will bee drawn to think, that whatever fine talk you might have about God and Heaven, your hearts were moſt upon the ſame things that theirs were, ſince your grief for their removal, is as great as theirs. They know by experience, what a ſtay it is to the heart, to have an able, faithful friend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon, or to have hopes of a great eſtate ſhortly to fall to them; and they'l never be perſwaded, you have any ſuch ground of comfort, if they ſee you as much caſt down, as thoſe that pretend to no ſuch matter. By this means, the precepts of Chriſt to conſtancy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all eſtates, will come to bee lookt upon (like thoſe of the <hi>Stoicks</hi>) only as <hi>Magnifica verba,</hi> Brave words, but ſuch as are impoſſible to bee practis'd; and the whole of the Goſpel will be taken for an Aiery notion, ſince they that profeſs greateſt regard to it, are no more helpt thereby. Oh what a ſhame is it; that Religion ſhould in this caſe make no more difference betwixt man and man! That it ſhould not, do I ſay? Yes ſurely it will, where ever it is in truth and power. For does not the eſſence of it, lye in the ſouls being brought off from the world, and ſelf-will, to the love of God and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him? Wherefore ſo much ſubmiſſion to his will, ſo much holineſs and religion there is in the ſoul. Oh Sirs, theſe (though they make not ſuch a noiſe and ſhew in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63182:65"/>the world) are better differences of a godly man from a wicked, than any outward profeſſion and performances; (though theſe alſo may have their uſe and excellence.) Wherefore ſhew to the world (what ever their common cenſures are) that it is not ſo much your care to differ from them in ſome by-opinions and little ſtrictneſſes, as in humility, meekneſs, contempt of the World, and heavenly-mindedneſs. And now let theſe graces diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play themſelves, by your chearful, patient deportment under all your grievances.

'Tis very probable it might have ſuch effects upon you, if receiv'd in the power of it: for we finde it had no leſs upon thoſe firſt Chriſtians, who ſo willingly ſold all they had, and laid it at the Apoſtles feet. And why ſhould the Goſpel be the leſs regarded, becauſe you have been long acquainted with it? Its own worth, and the mercie to you is never the leſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought your eſteem of it, and its force upon you to be as great: Eſpeciallie, ſince it hath pleaſed God to make it effectual to your ſouls, and hath thereby brought you to the knowledge and love of himſelf, through Jeſus Chriſt. And is not this ſuch a peculiar important fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that it may make you bear any thing comfortably, which is no prejudice to it? To have God enrich and adorn you with the graces of his Spirit, to give his Son to be your Husband and Head, and himſelf, through him to become your loving Father and ſatisfying portion, what would you deſire, or what can you have more than this? Or what can come amiſs to you whilſt you have it? There was ſome reaſon, though mixt with harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in <hi>Joab</hi>'s ſpeech to <hi>David,</hi> when hee took him up ſo roundly for his unſeaſonable, exceſſive lamentations of <hi>Abſaloms</hi> death, after a rebellion had been ſuppreſt by the gaining of a victory, telling him (with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words) that he <hi>perceiv'd if Abſolom had liv'd, and all the peopl died, it had pleaſed him well,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.6.

For does not your carriage ſeem to ſpeak, <hi>that if the world had liv'd and flouriſht with you, though all your other comforts had died, it had pleas'd you well?</hi> And does not his ſhew (as <hi>David</hi> is there charg'd) <hi>that you love your enemies, and have but little regard for your friends?</hi> For tell
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63182:68"/>me, if you account the mercies that are left you of more worth than thoſe that are fled away, why do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce more in thoſe which you have, than grieve for the want of theſe? And may not God juſtly ſay to you (to continue the alluſion) <hi>that if you will not ariſe and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, all the kindneſs hee hath hitherto ſhewn you, ſhall bee withdrawn? And that would indeed be worſe for you, than any evil that hath befaln you, from your youth until now.</hi> Muſt it not needs be highly diſpleaſing to God, to ſee his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not to be content with him alone, except they may have their part in the creature as others have? will not even carnal men in this reſpect condemn you? For they can make a kinde of miſerable ſhift <hi>without God in the world,</hi> and cannot you finde enough in God for your ſatisfaction without the world? How, I beſeech you, can this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with your profeſſion to take him for your God? By which we mean a Being in whom all perfections and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, all that is needful or deſirable for the ſoul, is to be plenteouſly found. And can that be really taken for your God, in the having of which, you reckon not your ſelves abundantly provided for in every regard? Do you think indeed, there is not enough in God to make thoſe that love him, at all times, perfectlie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatlie happy, though they had no creature in the world to reſt upon? May not they, to whom <hi>the Lord is the portion of their cup and their inheritance,</hi> well ſay, that their <hi>cup runneth over,</hi> and that they have a <hi>goodly heritage,</hi> though they ſhould not have one foot of Land, nor ſcarce a bit of Bread to put in their mouths? Certainly God is all and more than all, and they that enjoy his favour, can want no good thing, but may alwaies glory in that ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie and redundancie of felicitie laid up for them in him. Even here on earth, in the abſence of all other comforts, God hath waies of conveying more ſuitable ſubſtantial comfort, than the whole world can afford, to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63182:68"/>believing Souls that have their whole recourſe to, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately hang upon him. You that have <hi>taſted that the Lord is Gracious,</hi> cannot but acknowledge this. Wherefore, call to minde your own experiences of his goodneſs, and what many of his dear ſervants have left upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that they have found from him in the day of their diſtreſs; and hereby ſet your ſouls a longing after him: Preſs hard after the moſt cloſe and intimate communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, and reſt not till you feel your ſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd and chear'd with thoſe communications of himſelf, which he is wont to beſtow upon ſuch neceſſitous, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie ſouls, as being not onlie emptied of the creature, but of love to it, breathe after nothing ſo much, as more of God. And when you are thus rejoicing in him, more than in all riches, what is it that can ſadden you? when you are ſatisfied in him as with marrow and fatneſs, what want can you feel? But moreover, how may it yet even farther advance you above the troubleſome ſenſe of all your preſſures, to remember, that your preſent ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt delicious taſtes of Divine favour, are but the overflowings of that cup, which will afford you full draughts to all eternitie; ſome rivulets ſtreaming from that immenſe ocean of goodneſs and joy, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee exhauſted.

Though your Bills and Bonds may be burn't, yet ſo are not the Promiſes which convey this inheritance: though your Bibles themſelves ſhould be burnt, yet the Covenant of Grace remains firm; Heaven and Earth ſhall ſooner paſs away, than one tittle of Gods Word fail. And you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the firſt-fruits of this your future portion, <hi>viz.</hi> the indwellings of the Holy Spirit, which may aſſure you the fulneſs of glory remains for you in the heavens. And both theſe it was that made the Chriſtians, I before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>to take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods; as knowing they had in themſelves</hi> (for ſo plainly the words lie in the Original) <hi>a better ſubſtance</hi> (the Graces of the Spirit) <hi>and induring in the Heavens,</hi> (Glory it ſelf) <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. Wherefore inſtead of making ſuch a matter of your pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie loſſes, pray for your ſelves, as <hi>Paul</hi> for his <hi>Epheſians. That God would give you the Spirit of wiſdome and revelation in the knowledge of him; the eyes of your underſtanding being enlightned, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints,</hi> Epheſ. 1.17, 18. For did you clearlier know this, you would judge it more reaſonable for the wealthieſt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen to bee dejected for his loſſes than you, whoſe verie earneſt is of more value than all his wealth. 'Tis you, Sirs, and you only, who know no end of your riches, neither as to their greatneſs, or duration, whereas all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be fathom'd and exhauſted: If God be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and everlaſting, ſo is your portion; when you are reflecting upon your loſſes, conſider your ſelves as upon the borders of the other world, and ſee how they dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle into a matter of nothing: <hi>A man that's now going to be for ever perfectly bleſſed in the full enjoyment of God, hath
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63182:70"/>loſt a little money by the way.</hi> Oh heavie chance! If you were to die within this moneth or year, how little would this affect you? For you know how theſe things are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and valued on the other ſide the grave, how Angels and Saints care for heaps of gold: How ſhort a while then would you have been better for all that's gone from you? And can you not over-look that inch of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and approaching death? Forethink, moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, how leſs than nothing theſe now ſo terrible things will appear, when you are got ſafe into heaven, what is it to <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome, that once he lay at. <hi>Dives</hi> his gate? And will it be any thing to you what a loſs you had in 1666. when you are lodg'd in Eternitie? Why then ſhould that be ſo much to you now, which will ſhortlie be as if it had never been? To conclude, when all you are plac't ſo advantageouſlie in that higher ſtate, whence you may take a view of the whole Series of Providence, and the ſeveral means whereby the good of the Church and your own particular Salvation were carried on, and ſhall ſee what a tendencie thoſe Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations had to this end, which here ſeemed moſt dark and amazing, how will you be rais'd to the admiration of his Wiſdome and Power who ſate at the Stern, and by all theſe ſtrange tranſactions fulfilled the counſel of his own moſt bleſſed will? And the fore-thoughts of this, ſhould now beget in you the like frame, whilſt you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that which yet you cannot ſee.</p>
            <p>From all that hath been ſaid is farther manifeſt, what a vaſt difference there is betwixt your condition, who are Gods peculiar people, and theirs who are ſtrangers to him, whilſt to outward appearance your ſufferings are the ſame; and therefore how fit is it that your demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhould be accordinglie better than theirs? It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not you to think or ſpeak at the rates they do. For a man to have his worldlie intereſt, and all hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering it quite broken, is with them to be utterlie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63182:70"/>ſo they plainlie ſpeak, and ſuch are their verie thoughts: But will you judge your ſelves <hi>undone,</hi> whilſt you have God dwelling within you, and an heaven where you ſhall ever dwell with God? Undone indeed you would be, if your God was gone as theirs is; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blame not the poor men if they take on, <hi>for what have they more?</hi> But all you the Favourites and Heirs of Heaven, Children of the Moſt High, to whom you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to have whollie given up your ſelves, to you I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my Exhortation as I began it, that you would not diſcover any ſuch ſorrow or impatience, under this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as ſuits not with your Honourable Relation and Profeſſion; or as ſpeaks you both unmindful of the many great reaſons you have for contentedneſs and joy, and careleſs of improving them when they are ſuggeſted to you.</p>
            <p>Two more Objections which may here probably be ſtarted, I would willinglie remove.</p>
            <p>Object. 1. <hi>Some may ſay, yes indeed, if we had aſſurance of the love of God, that we are his children, and ſhould for ever live with him in glory, we could comfortably bear all that he hath laid upon us, as proceeding from love: But how can we, when we have reaſon to fear the contrary, and to regard his judgements as tokens of his diſpleaſure againſt us for our ſins?</hi> To the ſeveral things in this Objection, I ſhall frame an anſwer in two or three particulars, very brieſlie.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If indeed you want aſſurance of Gods love (whereby I mean ſuch well-grounded hopes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable apprehenſions thereof, as ordinarilie prevail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your doubts and fears, and enable you chearfullie to expect death and judgement.) If, I ſay, you have not this, is it not your wiſeſt courſe diligentlie to ſet your ſelves to attain it, in the uſe of thoſe means that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to that purpoſe, rather than to ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſtill and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie give way to your deſpondencies, and thereby aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63182:71"/>all other troubles into an intollerable weight? Would this aſſurance be ſo profitable (as you your ſelves acknowledge) and ſo fortifie your ſpirits againſt all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults whatever, and will you not be quickned to look after it? Since, in that meaſure I have mention'd, it may be got and kept by diligent, humble, watchful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. The method you can hardlie be ignorant of, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo plain and ſo frequentlie preſt upon you, <hi>viz.</hi> That you ſhould ſtudie well the terms of the Covenant of Grace, and examine whether you are willing to come up to thoſe terms; that you ſhould ſearch the Scripture, what manner of perſons it tells you ſhall be ſaved; and then ſearch your own hearts whether you be ſuch, and if you are not, without any more delay, to do what in you lies to become ſuch. And not to digreſs now to the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of marks and ſigns, let me onlie wiſh you to conſider what I have before intimated, <hi>That your patient bearing of Gods hand is a ſingular evidence of your ſincerity:</hi> For ſince the principal effect of true Religion is, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the ſoul to the Will of God, then a ſubjection to ſuch inſtances of it as are ſo croſs to our carnal inclinations, is a good diſcovery of a truly Religious man. He that <hi>keeps himſelf ſo unſpotted from the world,</hi> that he is neither polluted with inordinate love to it, whilſt in his hands, nor muddied with foul and turbulent paſſions when its taken out of them, his <hi>Religion is pure and undefiled before God.</hi> To bridle theſe motions of the heart, as well as of the tongue, ſhew our <hi>Religion</hi> not to be <hi>vain.</hi> But take heed of perverting this to your farther trouble, crying out, that you then perceive your condition worſe than ever, ſince you are ſo far from this temper of mind: but rather be engag'd to greater induſtry with your hearts now at length to bring them thereto, ſince when you have done this, from this patience and meekneſs may flow that aſſurance which hitherto you have ſought in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63182:71"/>vain; for by the exerciſe of Grace, the being and truth of it is beſt diſcovered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you judge that it is for your ſins you now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and Conſcience tells you plainlie and trulie, what thoſe ſins are, your onlie way is humblie to acknowledge them before God, to repent of and ſpeedilie ſet againſt them, that hereby you may get a pardon, and the ſenſe of it, and ſo may attain to ſatisfaction and comfort.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And know farther, this ſincere and ingenuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which God requires at your hands, is no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with that quiet frame of ſpirit which I adviſe you to: He calls for no unprofitable, perplexing grief, but for that alone which may be for your good, which may bring you more thorowlie from the love of ſin, and ſo be a means to joy it ſelf. And eaſilie may you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that this godlie ſorrow for ſin may well conſiſt with patience under ſuffering: for cannot a man, whoſe exceſs hath brought him into a Surfeit, at the ſame time be griev'd for that folly which procur'd his ſickneſs, and yet content with the bitter Phyſick which may cure him of it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Furthermore, Need I tell you what an unſound ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it is, to conclude from your afflictions, that you are not in favour with God? Do you think it reaſonable or ſafe, to argue from our proſpering in the World, that we are beloved of him, and our wayes well pleaſing to him? And is there any more reaſon to judge the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie from cur adverſitie? Were the Apoſtles, when exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd, as upon a Theatre, with ſufferings of all ſorts, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteemed by God? Or when he brought forth <hi>Job,</hi> to combat with thoſe evils which Satan had libertie to bring againſt him, did he do it becauſe he was angry with him, or did not love him? Though his friends indeed would needs have had it ſo, yet that good man was ſo juſt both to God and himſelf, that he would not believe them.

            <p>Yea, laſtly, Grant that for ſome particular ſins you are afflicted, yet have I not ſhewn, that even this may be an evidence of Gods love, and ſo far a ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to you? Is it not love to reduce you to himſelf from thoſe waies that might be your ruine? He that ſhould pluck you back, when in an humor you was running to drown your ſelf, though he might tear your cloathes in ſtrugling, yet ſhould have your heartie thanks, when you were com'n to a better mind. Pray tell me, cannot you hate your ſin, and yet love your ſelves? Yea, do you not then love your ſelves beſt, when you do moſt againſt it? And may not God do ſo too? Your ſin he hates, and wills the death of it, and ſends afflictions to that end; but all this while he loves your ſouls, and therefore takes this courſe with their Enemies. What reaſon then have you but to acknowledge this love, and ſubmit to all its methods for your recoverie? And by this your compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with, and improvement of his dealings, you may beſt make it out that they came from love, and therefore are to be born comfortablie, according to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, bleſſed be God very much; ſince he hath ſo well conſulted for us, that there is no poiſon in nature without its attending antidote; no trouble <hi>common to man,</hi> for which there is not ſuitable proviſion made.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would have you call to mind how much is ſaid in Scripture to ſecure Gods ſervants from theſe fears. You know that <hi>godlineſs hath the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come:</hi> You are bid not to perplex your ſelves with thoughts what you ſhall eat and wear, ſince your heavenlie Father knows what you need, and will take care for you accordingly. <hi>When the young Lions ſuffer hunger, they that fear the Lord ſhall want no good thing: Their bread ſhall be given them, and their water ſhall be ſure; and their ſouls ſhall be kept alive in famine. David</hi> in his time <hi>had not ſeen the righteous forſaken, nor his Seed begging bread.</hi> And though theſe, with a multitude the like, are not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken altogether abſolutelie, yet I ſuppoſe its ſeldome known but they are in ſome meaſure made good to all the godlie. It is but a verie few in the hardeſt times (if we except extraordinarie famines) that periſh for lack of food; but when did you know a good man do ſo? And why ſhould you think that will happen to you which ſo ſeldome doth to any?</p>
            <p n="2">2. You cannot, I believe ſay, that this is yet your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that your wants are ſo pinching that you have no way of relief left you any longer. Did your Children e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ask bread when you had it not to give them? Have you not ſtill one way or other found ſuccour at your greateſt need? And yet have not your ſtraits been as great as ever they are like to be? And have you not the ſame God to depend upon? How exceedinglie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed was he with the unbelieving murmurings of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63182:73"/>
               <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who had oft beheld his power imployed for their ſeaſonable relief? And why ſhould not your expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience engage you to truſt in him? Eſpeciallie ſince this is the beſt way to have his promiſes fulfilled to you; I mean, by your relying upon him for whatever you want, with this perſwaſion, that if it be good for you, it ſhall be given in; and that it proceeds not from lack of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, truth or mercie in God, if you go without it. Is it not againſt all reaſon, and your own eaſe, by unbelief and carnal fears to anticipate your troubles, and by frightful imagination; to put your ſelves to greater pain than ever your condition is like to do? Are we not told, that <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the day is the evil thereof;</hi> and taught to pray for <hi>daily bread?</hi> Perhaps you have not another day to live, and then you are provided for; or if you have, this daies bread is a good pledge that it ſhall be given to morrow. And remember, there may be a greater diſtance betwin you and ſtarving than you imagine, onlie perhaps you take it for a grievous matter to live at lower rates than you were heretofore wont.</p>
            <p>But laſtlie, Suppoſe the thing you fear ſhould come upon you, even that you and yours ſhould come to die for want of bread, yet is there no ſuch intollerable evil herein, that either the fore-thoughts, or the feeling of it, ſhould overwhelm your ſpirits, and leave you deſtitute of all comfort. It is not this, as dreadful as it ſeems, that can make a good man miſerable, why then ſhould it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright you ſo much? Lay aſide, I entreat you, all paſſion and prejudice, and calmlie conſider the verie truth of the caſe: Can ſtarving bring any thing worſe than death? And may not the Command of Chriſt here be of force; That we ſhould not <hi>fear that which can kili the body only, and then hath nothing more to do?</hi> What will it be to you, when once its over, what death you died on? Will the joyes of heaven be the leſs for the pains of that death
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63182:73"/>that brought you thither? Nay, and as to matter of pain, queſtionleſs manie a rich man, who hath long lain tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with the Gout, or Stone, hath felt more pain than ever poor man did, though famiſht to death. And as to the diſgrace, (which is reckoned one of the worſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of povertie) it is but matter of Opinion, which a wiſe man ought to live above. And if it may the more convince you, hear what a verie Heathen ſpeaks to this purpoſe: <hi>Thou art afraid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leaſt thou ſhouldſt want neceſſaries; art thou ſo blinde that thou canſt not foreſee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this want will bring thee? even thither, that a Feaver or any mortal wound does, namely, to death. And hast thou not often gloried of thy willingneſs to die? True, but my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will famiſh alſo; what then? Will this carry them any whither elſe? Is not the paſſage the ſame, and the ſtate after death the ſame? Wilt thou not therefore, with a mind fortified againſt all fears of hunger and want, look thitherward, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Emperours and Kings, and the richeſt upon earth must at length deſcend? Only thou perhaps mayſt be kill'd with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury, they with drunkenneſs and gluttony.</hi> What a ſhame is it then for a Chriſtian to be daunted with thoſe things which an Heathen could perceive ſo harmleſs? Though he could tell ſo little of any ſtate after death that ſhould make amends for the troubleſome paſſage into it. Know then for certain, that whilſt God hath any work for you to do on earth, hee'l maintain you in it: Rather will he rain Manna from heaven, or turn the ſtones into bread, than let his ſervants want, whilſt he ſees fit to have their daies lengthened out. But when he is pleaſed to cut off the thread of life, you may well enough bear it, to have the ſtaff of life withdrawn. When your journey's at an end, what need you take care for proviſion for the way? And needs muſt your proviſion laſt as long as your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; for when it all fails, your journey's at an end. As the good woman valiantlie, when the Popiſh Perſecutors

Wherefore let the confidence and reſolution of <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk,</hi> be yours alſo, that though there ſhould neither be fruit in the field, nor meat in the ſhambles, yet <hi>you will rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of your Salvation, Hak</hi> 3.17, 18. Now though the fears of this calamity are for the moſt part very groundleſs, yet I was willing to ſuppoſe a caſe as bad almoſt as is poſſible to fal out, that you might bee convinc'd, there is no ſuch condition whereinto you can be brought, that doth neceſſit ate, or will juſtifie your dejection and diſtruſt.</p>
            <p>And if indeed <hi>the people are in ſo happy a caſe whoſe God is the Lord,</hi> that no calamities need affright nor can undo them; then let me hence take riſe for an exhortation (wherewith I ſhall conclude) to all the ſerious and true hearted Chriſtians in the Land, into whoſe hands theſe lines may fall, <hi>that in the midſt of all the miſeries and dangers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we ſeem ſurrounded and threatned, they would be of good chear, ſummon up their fainting ſpirits, and fortifie themſelves to a reſolute, undaunted expectation of the worſt that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us.</hi>

Wherefore though you walk even through the valley of the ſhadow of death, yet fear none ill, ſince God is with you, who is a very preſent help in trouble, whoſe name is a ſtrong tower, whereto the Righteous run and are ſafe. When <hi>Saul</hi> the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of an Armie, and Ruler of a Kingdome may, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his minde, run to a witch for relief; and <hi>Achitophel</hi> the great Politician may have recourſe to an halter, yet are they never in any caſe deſtitute of a refuge, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Almightie, and dwell under the ſhadow of his wings. Does God, even your God, reign in the earth, and will you fear any thing that can betide you whil'ſt you are in it? Are you not alwaies in his hands, and where elſe can you be ſafer than there? Muſt you not truſt your ſouls with him, when you go hence to that other world, to which you are yet ſo ſtrange? And be whollie at his diſpoſing, what emploiment, ſocietie, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you ſhall bee in for ever. Can you then truſt him for eternitie, and not for a year or two till you come thither? As confuſed as the affairs of this world may ſeem, he hath not caſt them out of his hands, but governs all in perfect order, according to the nature and capacitie of the ſubject. When ſtorms ariſe that ſeem to threaten the ſhip you are in, you may apprehend him ſaying to you, <hi>Be of good chear, it is I; I that raiſe (or at leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) and I who will lay their troubleſome tempeſt.</hi> It would not indeed (as the principal Philoſopher ſaies) be worth while, to live in a world deſtitute of Providence: but this is not ſo. No events can befall, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of that <hi>will,</hi> which you dailie pray <hi>may be done,</hi> and is in ſome ſenſe done, <hi>on earth as it is in heaven;</hi> ſo
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63182:75"/>that I may ſay, the whole world is rul'd according to your praiers. And need you fear any thing from the will of God, ſince it is his eternal and unchangeable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that nothing ſhall make thoſe men miſerable, who love him, and ſubmit themſelves to his righteous admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations? Whilſt therefore you live under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as you alwaies do, and can meet with nothing but what he is pleas'd ſhould come to paſs (as you never can) how boldlie may you hold on your courſe, though encountred with all thoſe terrours which diſmay the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, and cauſe them to run hither and thither, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and lamenting? Fire and Sword, Peſtilence and Famine, though they may well terrifie thoſe that converſe with creatures only (having no better a portion, and no greater ſtrength, than what they afford) yet the man that is arm'd with a ſelf-reſignation to, and confidence in God, may with an unbroken minde, march through the thickeſt troops of theſe deaths and dangers: as having God for his felicitie, from whom they cannot force him; and for his continual help, and therefore they cannot vanquiſh him. Yea, may I not adde, he beholds all theſe as fighting under the Banner of the Lord of Hoſts, whoſe ſervant he is, and whoſe cauſe he hath eſpouſed: Why then ſhould he be more afraid to go through them, than ſome known friend of the Generals, is to walk through the midſt of his armed men? Though he may go by the mouths of Cannons ready fixt, and the points of drawn Swords, yet he dreads them not, ſince theſe inſtruments of death are prepar'd for their enemies, not their friends. When any of theſe overflowing ſcourges paſs over a Nation, and ſeem to take all before them, yet then have the Righteous the ſame ſecuritie and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that <hi>Noah</hi> and his company in the Ark had, in the time of the Deluge; what if I ſhould ſay, the ſame that the fiſhes then had above all other Creatures left
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63182:75"/>out? For whilſt they continue in compliance with that will which orders all things for them, they are never out of their proper element; whilſt they follow this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and keep out of the by-paths of wickedneſs, they are ſtill in their way. Not but that their bodies are as weak as other mens, and their outward enjoiments ſubject to the ſame caſualties: but their ſouls are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temper, and their happineſs of another nature, and cannot be deſtroied or loſt. Boldly may they defie all the Haſts of hell or earth that riſe up againſt them, ſince none of theſe can keep them from God whilſt they live, and do but tranſlate them to him when they die. Well therefore may you, whoſe intereſts are ſo ſecurely plac't, out of the reach of all violence and malice; ſing aloud with the bleſſed Apoſtle, whilſt in the midſt of his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; he juſtly triumphs like a Conquerour; <hi>Who ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, perſecution or famine, nakedneſs, peril or ſword? Nay, in all theſe things we are more than conquerours, through him that loved us: For I am perſwaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor things to come, nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> Rom. 8.35, 37, 38, 39. And what can be more comely, than all you upright ones, to return thanks and praiſe to that God, who hath dealt ſo graciouſly with you? And to rejoyce in your felicity, which he hath made ſo ſecure and inviolable? Inſtead of continual complainings of this miſery, and the other which is upon us, or fearful propheſyings of worſe yet to come, wherewith many are overmuch taken up. <hi>Let the high praiſes of God be in your mouths,</hi> who hath done ſo much for you, to make you at all times ſafe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore comfortable. Bleſſe him with all your Souls, for his ineſtimable love to mankinde, which he hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63182:76"/>by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>in whom hee is reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> and hath actually done that work upon you, whereby it comes to paſs, that being reconciled to the Creator, the whole Creation is ſo far at peace with you, that all the Creatures which ſtand on his ſide will not hurt you, and they that are his enemies cannot. Praiſe your Redeemer, who by his death hath ſlain your foes, ſpoil'd principallities and powers, diſabled Satan, overcom'n the world, and taken the ſting out of all affliction and death it ſelf; that you might walk ſecurely through this vale of tears, and depart out of it chearfully. Oh praiſe his name, that hee hath kept you from being deſtroyers of your ſelves, and will keep all other things from deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you. Bee thankful to him for the glorious light of his Goſpel, and for enlightning your mindes therewith, whereby you are made acquainted with the true nature of all things that concerns you; that ſo you might nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſtartled with thoſe Bugbears, which the fears and fancies of weak and guilty men, in the dark apprehend ſo terrible, nor fall into thoſe real miſchiefs, which ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant benighted ſinners run upon to their own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. God hath already done much for you, and hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you promiſes of very much more; praiſe him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for what you have, and for what you hope for: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the dawnings of Heaven in your ſouls, and for the promiſes of a fuller glory hereafter, to be revealed in you. And through the hopes of this, bee you ever <hi>fild with peace and joy in beleiving.</hi> And with the frequent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of all his loving-kindneſs, be ſtill <hi>making melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in your hearts to the Lord, giving thanks alwaies for all things unto God and our Father, in the name of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have before endeavoured to take off thoſe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances to this frame which might ariſe from worldly croſſes: for if they ſo little deſerve our ſorrow, when
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63182:76"/>they befall us (as I have fullie manifeſted) how much leſs do they deſerve our ſorrow and fear, leaſt they ſhould? And indeed it was my deſign, not onlie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thoſe that have met with troubles, but to prepare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for whatever they may meet with. But there is yet another Objection behind, that may appear of more weight than any of the former, which I cannot altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſs over in ſilence, ſince fain I would do ſomething for the removal of all ſhelters and pretences for carnal fears and faintings, which do ſo much pinch and wrong Chriſtian ſouls, hinder the pleaſantneſs and benefit of their Societie, and eclipſe the glorie of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Perhaps then ſome may tell me, <hi>That this is an unſeaſonable time to call men to joy and chearfulneſs, when ſuch heavy judgements lie upon us, and ſuch a black cloud hangs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, (and God is angry with thoſe who takes no notice of, nor lay to heart his hand) when we conſider alſo the low eſtate of Gods Church, both at home and abroad. When the Church in former times was in ſuch a condition, we find what bitter la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations holy men were wont to make: The loſs of the Ark coſt</hi> Eli's <hi>life, and</hi> Nehemiahs <hi>ſerrow of heart, when</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>lay waſte, was ſo great, that the King took notice of it by the change of his countenance,</hi> Neh. 2.2. <hi>Why then ſhould it not be ſo with us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In anſwer whereto, Firſt let me repeat the Caution I have before laid down, that you ſhould not think I am perſwading you to be regardleſs of Gods hand ſtretcht out againſt us; neither think, I beſeech you, that I perſwade you to any ſuch mirth and jollitie which might manifeſt this regardleſneſs. This is indeed provoking to God, when he calls to Faſting, Humiliation, and girding with Sackcloth, to behold killing of Sheep, and ſlaying of Oxen, Banquets and Revellings, with all kind of exceſs and brave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 'Tis to none of this that I
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63182:77"/>call you, not to haunt Taverns and Playhouſes, feaſtings and dancings, to ſing and drink away your reaſon and fears together; rather do you pitie their diſtraction who take this courſe, whilſt they may deride your ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So far am I from this, that on the other hand, I do earneſtlie deſire you to labour for the moſt awakened ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Gods dealings with us, and the deſign of them, that you may be ſuitablie affected therewith, and meet him in the way of his judgements, rightlie beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your ſelves under the ſame: But all this may be done without ſlaviſh dejections and terrours, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie I plead againſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yea furthermore, as to what evils may be yet hanging over us, my counſel alſo is, that you would ſo far apprehend and expect them, as may put you upon the uſe of thoſe means which are likelieſt to prevent them, or as may tend to prepare you for them, whilſt your fears have no worſe effects than to quicken you to dailie earneſt ſtrivings with God on the behalf of this poor Nation, and to a careful Reformation of your ſelves and families, and a ſerious endeavour (according to your place and capacitie) that others ſhould do the like, in order to the removal of what judgements we feel, and the prevention of thoſe we fear; this while I condemn them not. Moreover, whilſt you are ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to your ſelves the worſt that can in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood happen, that you may not be ſurpriz'd thereby, but may get furniſht with ſuitable ſtrength and comfort, you act wiſelie: But this is a different thing from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch miſgiving, ghaſtlie fore-thoughts thereof, as onlie weaken and torment you. Hath not Chriſt bid his ſervants when they <hi>hear of wars, and rumors of wars, to ſee they be not troubled?</hi> And in all the calamities that came upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> God would ſtill have the Remnant that was faithful, ſpoke comfortablie to. In thoſe great and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63182:77"/>aſtoniſhing changes which God makes in the world, root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Kingdomes for the wickedneſs of the Inhabitants, tranſlating the Goſpel from one Nation to another; we performing our dutie, muſt lay our hands on our mouths, ſtand on the Lords ſide, and acknowledge he is righteous in all his waies; as remembring, <hi>it is not our work to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the world, but to ſubmit to him that does.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſame again may be ſaid as to thoſe diſorders which you complain of, at home or abroad, ſo far as your trouble hath a tendencie toward their removal, or any other good end, it is a dutie, but no farther. I'le joyn with you a little in complaining and acknowledge, that its ſad to think how great a part of the world lies buried in Heatheniſh darkneſs, idolatrie and infidelitie, and how little is done by Chriſtians toward their relief; eſpeciallie that the Princes of Chriſtendome do no more imploy their intereſts to that purpoſe, as if the pettie temporal concerns of their Crown and Kingdome were of greater moment. Sad alſo it is to ſee Chriſtendome it ſelf ſo wofullie divided and crumbled into Parties and Factions, through the carnal deſigns of ambitious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous men, under the gilded pretences of Catholick peace and unitie; and how great a part of it by this means is over-ſpread with ignorance, impietie and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie? to the diſgrace of our profeſſion, and hindrance of the Converſion of Jews and Heathens. Its ſad to obſerve what a cruel raging thirſt there is in theſe falſe Chriſtians, after the utter ruine and deſtruction of all that crouch not to them, but value the Goſpel above their rotten Traditions, and ſenſleſs ſapleſs Superſtitions. And ſad it is, that in our own and other Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the diviſions ſhould be ſo great about matters of little moment, whilſt the Common Enemie threatens to ſwallow them up; that the power of Godlineſs, and all ſuch means as may promote it, are no more ſet up
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63182:78"/>and encouraged, that profaneneſs, lukewarmneſs, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual heart-burnings and diſcontents, ſhould ſo univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie poſſeſs us. Theſe are all very ſad conſiderations. But what then? Muſt we therefore ſit down, over-weigh'd with the burdenſome ſenſe of all theſe evils, and ſpend our daies in weeping and wailing, becauſe the World we live in is ſo much out of order? By this means Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould all turn Diſciples of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> his School. But certainlie the Precepts of Jeſus Chriſt put us upon no ſuch courſe, who would have us live free from all anxious corroding cares, and the verie office of whoſe Spirit it is, to be the <hi>Comforter</hi> of his people. <hi>Mourners in Zion</hi> we may be, but diſconſolate ſelf-tormentors we muſt not. The ſame <hi>Paul</hi> that took <hi>care of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, rejoyc't in hope of the glorie of God, and did alwayes triumph in Chriſt.</hi> All thoſe evils which I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd may in one word be reduc't to this, that there is ſo much wickedneſs in the world, and ſo little true Religion and fear of God. And this I grant, muſt needs be matter of lamentation to all good men, that love their Maker and their Fellow-creatures, and I wiſh that all our hearts were more kindlie affected herewith. But how is it we ſhould manifeſt our ſelves thus well-affected? Truly moſt of all by endeavouring all that in us lies, that the world may be amended; and ſo far as our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, examples, or inſtructions, may do any thing to that end, let us faithfullie apply our ſelves thereto. But ſuch a grief as hurts our ſelves, and offers nothing to the good of others, ought to be avoided: We ſhould not in ſuch an unprofitable manner, mourn for our own ſins; ſurelie then not for other mens. It would go but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us, if the comfort of our lives depended upon ſuch things as are no way in our power to accompliſh. It is indeed well-beſeeming a dutiful Son to be grieved for the diſobedience of his Brethren, but yet not ſo far as to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63182:78"/>hinder the pleaſure he ought to take in his Fathers love, and the performance of his own duty to him. But this pure and unfeigned ſorrow for the wickedneſs of the world, and the diſhonors done to God therein, ſpeaks ſo much ingenuity of ſoul, and is ſo very rare, that I need ſay little to dehort you from the exceſs of it; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I may exhort you to it, to be yet more poſſeſt with a bitter hatred of ſin and pitty to poor ſinners; but not in the leaſt, I beſeech you, with hatred or envie of the moſt proſperous and flouriſhing of them; and be very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over your ſelves, that no worldlie trouble, not your loſſes, nor ſtraits, your want of trading, nor heavy pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lie nearer to your heart, than the Intereſt of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But if by the low eſtate of the Church you mean chiefly the Perſecution which it is any where under; or which you feel your ſelves, or apprehend to be coming upon us, I may well ſay, there is far leſs cauſe of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon this account than the former. If God ſee it good to have his Church purified and refined, by bringing it through the fire, who are we that we ſhould contradict it? Need I mention to you the many benefits that are hereby wont to accrue to Chriſtians, to whom it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as their common Road to heaven? Do you not know that Chriſt hath bid you then eſpecially to rejoyce and be exceeding glad, when men ſay and do all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evil againſt you for his ſake? Doth not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle reckon it as a gift and priviledge to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that they did not onlie believe in, but ſuffer for Chriſt? <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29.</p>
            <p>And to theſe ſame ſuffering <hi>Philippians</hi> it was, that he gives that earneſt Exhortation, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and again I ſay rejoyce, Chap.</hi> 4.4. And how many more Texts of this ſort might I mention, as thoſe alſo which ſhew, that ſuch was the joyful ſpirit of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63182:79"/>and Primitive Chriſtians under their perfecutions for the truth. So far ought we to be from ſorrow or ſhame for ſuffering as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that we are commanded to <hi>glorifie God on this behalf,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.16. But here then let me deſire you, as you value the true peace and comfort of your ſouls, to ſee that you indeed ſuffer as <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> both as to what you ſuffer for, that it be no other than the Cauſe of Chriſt; and as to your deſign in imbracing it, that it be purelie for his honor, and then you are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuffer in that manner that becomes Chriſtians. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, I beſeech you, of adhering, with a carnal zeal, to any Sect or Party, for the advancement and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof you are wholly concern'd, as depending thereupon for your eſtate and eaſe; and chiefly for your Reputation, by the ſucceſs of your Opinion and way. If this ſelfiſhneſs poſſeſs you, it will even then when you ſeem to ſuffer for Conſcience ſake, bewray it ſelf by much-what the ſame effects, that are to be ſeen in the men of this world, when they contend with, and oppreſs one another. It will ſet you a vexing and repining, and fill your mouths with reviling, and your minds with ſpleen againſt thoſe that make you ſmart: And this while you are like to be far from the comfort of a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſtate; and no wonder, for tell me truly, Is it not for Self, rather than Chriſt that you are thus affected? Doth Chriſt, do you think, need or deſire that you ſhould have ſuch boiſterous paſſions for his ſake? Doth the wrath of man work the righteouſneſs of God? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee that you are but ſincerely concern'd for Gods Glorie and your own Salvation, and then you'l perceive that in theſe reſpects men cannot hurt or overcome you; and ſo you'l ſee no reaſon to be angry with them, or hate them for any thing they do to you. For by doing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and exerciſing the Graces that are call'd for, and may yet be done, you may glorifie God, and ſave your
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63182:79"/>ſouls, let men and devils rage, and reign, and do their worſt. Let the times be what they will, you have ſtill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſerve and pleaſe God, though not alwayes in the ſame works, or after the ſame manner. Sometimes <hi>Paul</hi> may be glorifying God by preaching boldly in a Synagogue, or in his own hired houſe; ſometimes by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his feet in the Stocks, ſometimes by pleading at a Bar, and ſometimes by preaching in a Priſon, though but to the Jaylor and his Familie; and all this while by courage and patience, love to Chriſt, and zeal for the Goſpel and the good of ſouls, which, according to the variety of occaſions and circumſtances, ſtill exerted it ſelf one way or other. Religion, as it is an inward living Principle, lies far out of the reach of all created force, and can no more be interrupted or deſtroyed thereby (whilſt the ſoul is faithful to its ſelf) than the influences of the Stars, or courſe of the Orbs, can be bound and ſtopt. It is indeed in the power of man to hinder ſome external duties, to diſcountenance and impoveriſh good men, but what's this to the heart and life of Religion? Though they may diſturb the Communion of Chriſtians, yet not that betwixt God and the Soul; 'tis not a ſtone wall can intercept that: They may put chains on the feet, but not on the affections, nor hinder their outgoings to God, any more than <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Chain (which in a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rage he threw into a rough Sea) could reſtrain the ſwelling of its waves: Though ſome kind of outward ſplendour and flouriſhing of Religion may be eclipit, yet the fruits of the Spirit cannot, by the nipping Froſts of Perſecution, be blaſted. Such as the Apoſtle menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>Love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance;</hi> of theſe I may ſay as he does (though in another ſenſe) <hi>againſt ſuch there is no Law:</hi> Or though there ſhould be a Law, yet there is no power againſt them. Though Enemies perſecute
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63182:80"/>you, yet you may love and pitty them, whether they will or no: Though they ſhould ſtop your mouths, yea, pluck out your tongues, yet you may pray for them, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them; you may be humble, patient, holy, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly in deſpite of all oppoſition, and were but all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours ſuch, Religion would flouriſh at another rate, than meerly by having the favour of great ones, and the riches and honours of the world entail'd upon their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. I wonder whether Religion flouriſht more for the firſt three hundred year after Chriſt, or after that it became the Religion of the Empire: Whether when men loſt eſtates by embracing it, or when they got them by profeſſing it?</p>
            <p>Was it Fire and Faggot, or Eaſe and Honours, that were the poiſon of the Church! And was it the blood of Martyrs, or the wealth of the Profeſſors, that was the ſeed of the Church? Wherefore let us not ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of any thing in the Times, as of our own ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and dulneſs, of the earthlineſs and unbelief of our hearts, and the unſuitableneſs of our lives, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuring the luſtre of Religion: And if Adverſity may ſcoure off all the ruſt and filth which eaſe and proſperity contracted, we ſhall have cauſe to praiſe him, <hi>who ſate as our refiner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here by the way, let mee ſuggeſt; that there is much difference betwixt the ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and the Chriſtian Church: That was under a lower and more carnal diſpenſation, both as to the frame of their minde, their ſervice and promiſes. They had not (generally) ſo great a meaſurre of the ſpirit as was afterward to be poured forth, nor ſo clear revelations of the future glory, neither therefore was it ſo preſt upon them, that the way thereto was, through many tribulations, which made them ſo extreamly ſcandaliz'd at that ſtrange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, that they muſt leave friends, lands, life,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63182:80"/>and all for his ſake, if they would be his Diſciples, and have a treaſure in Heaven. But eſpecially take notice, what a dependance their Worſhip had upon external things, being confin'd ſo much to the Temple in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and confiſting in ſuch Sacrifices and Ceremonies which could not other-where be performed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they might well be much concern'd for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and reſtauration of that place, whereto Gods peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar preſence was limited; and upon this account they were more obnoxious to enemies, and ſtood greatly in need of their favour, when conquered by them. But now in all theſe reſpects the caſe is different. The Apoſtles did not ſtay for <hi>Caeſars</hi> leave, nor depend upon his aid for building the Chriſtian Church, the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did upon <hi>Cyrus</hi> for the Old: (Though I grant the countenance of the Civil Magiſtrate, to bee a great mercy, neither ought Chriſtians, whether Paſtours or People, upon any pretence whatever, to diſobey his commands, whilſt they do not interfere with Chriſt:) Nor is it in Temples made with hands (though in ſuch we are to worſhip him in publick communion) that God now dwells, but in every holy Soul, who at any time, in any place, may worſhip him acceptably <hi>in ſpirit and in truth;</hi> And this <hi>Ark of his preſence,</hi> the inhabitation of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, no <hi>Philiſtine</hi> force can take out of the heart of man. Now by Jeſus Chriſt, hath God ſo far <hi>ſav'd us from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us, that</hi> (though we are more aſſaulted by them than ever, yet) <hi>we may ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs, all the daies of our life,</hi> as <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſings. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.71, 74, 75. Though Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>hee came to ſend n Sword upon earth,</hi> yet hee tells them alſo, that his peace ſhould abide in their hearts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world gives, give I unto you:</hi> For the world indeed gives peace, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63182:81"/>outward troubles, but my peace ſhall poſſeſs and ſecure you in the midſt of them (as a learned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator gloſſes upon the words) and therefore he adds that injunction, which I have been ſo long inculcating, <hi>Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be affraid.</hi>

            <p>And to finiſh my anſwer, let mee, in the laſt place, wiſh you to remember ſeriouſly and believingly, that what ever preſſures the Church of God, now militant upon the whole earth, or any part of it, may lie under; it ſhall, beſides its preſent victory, at length riſe up from under them into the moſt flouriſhing and triumphant ſtate: And all thoſe that are embark't therein, being faithful to her cauſe and quarrel, and ſharing in all her afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhall alſo partake of her glory. Even now, I ſay, all ſincere Chriſtians by their faith overcome the world, yea, when they ſeem moſt overcome by it; like their Maſter, they conquer, when upon the croſs: For it is not with him as with temporal Monarchs, whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt is ruin'd, when their Subjects are deſtroy'd, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſht; But his Kingdome is oft promoted by the ſufferings and ſlaughters of his followers. Nor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould we ſerve him with ſuch kinde of apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as common ſubjects are wont to have, in their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels for their King and Countrey, who are beforehand doubtful of the event, and being vanquiſht, bewail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and pitty their Prince. But hee whoſe battle we fight, does not ſo need our lives or fortunes, that his ſtrength ſhould be weakned by their loſs. Nor does he let his enemies ſo far prevail over his Church, becauſe through their power and policy they are too hard for him: Though there was not a man upon earth that would ſtand on his ſide, he would know well enough how to deal with the greateſt Potentates and Politicians of them all, as they will, ere long, know to their coſt: But hee bears thus with them (beſide other ends which will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63182:81"/>be better known) that the Graces which hee hath given to his Servants may bee exerciſed, and that they may have opportunities of demonſtrating, that they love him to the death. And this is all he cares for or requires, and whilſt we do thus, whatever becomes of us, we win the field, and are ſure of the crown: for our Lords King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and therefore ours, is not of this world; nor would he therefore have any upon pretence of advancing it, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the world by Maſſacres and Powder-plots, ſeditions and tumuls, murdering of Princes, and burning of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Theſe are fit means indeed to erect ſome <hi>Babel</hi> of carnal intereſt, but not for the building up of Chriſts Church: He knows how to defend and exalt it, without any ſuch officious wickedneſs, as ſome men by all means would bring to his aſſiſtance. And as it is not for want of power or love, that Chriſt ſuffers his Spouſe for a while to be trampled upon, by the feet of pride and cruelty; ſo hee will at length diſcover both, in delivering her thence, and placing her with himſelf in glory. He that purchaſt his Church with his own blood, will not be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied till ſhe partakes of the higheſt benefits of his coſtly undertaking. As in his own perſon he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and overcome all the Powers of Hell and Death, ſo he will go on conquering and to conquer, till he hath finiſht the ſame work for, and in his body. Now hee is purifying it from all ſpots and wrinckles, and will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after preſent it to himſelf beautiful and glorious. Why then ſhould not all the followers of this victorious Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, march on, with courage in their hearts, ſereneneſs in their looks, and ſongs of praiſe in their mouths, as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to <hi>Zion?</hi> where <hi>everlaſting joy ſhall bee upon their heads,</hi> and all remnants of <hi>ſorrow and mourning ſhall flee away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore ſtir up your ſelves, I beſeech you Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſit not alwaies poring upon miſeries, and overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63182:82"/>mercies, making things worſe than they are, and vexing your ſelves with needleſs fears. Remember ſtill, <hi>that a Childe of God in the way to his Fathers houſe, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies more cauſe of joy and thank fulneſs, than of ſadneſs and complaining:</hi> Let it appear that you beleive ſo by your deportment. And that you may riſe up to this truely excellent ſpirit, let me beſeech you, in one word, <hi>To ſee that you live up to the principles of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Be affected toward the world, and all its pomps and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as you are engag'd by your Baptiſm: Ever ſit looſe from it, and regard it not as any peice of your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 'Tis this fills mens mindes with anguiſh and care, even the fears of being depriv'd of their eſtates and friends, their fleſhly eaſe, their lives and liberties. But conſider you, that it's impoſſible to have a ſure hold of theſe things, and therefore the way never to be troubled for them, is, not to let them have hold of your hearts. You have liv'd to ſee in two years more men taken from their eſtates, and more eſtates taken from the owners, than in ſo ſhort a time hath almoſt been ever known: Let both teach you what regard to have, either to life it ſelf, or the appurtenances of it. Let your comfort in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, be deriv'd from God and Chriſt, the firſt fruits and promiſes of heaven, then may it be conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, as the grounds of it are. Ever be inculcating it upon your ſelves, that God is your felicity, and labour to make and keep it clear, that he is your God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as you love your lives, and the comforts of them, take heed of ſin, of all ſin, which will blot your Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and make you of abject, cowardly ſpirits; ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of fetching comfort from approaching to God, this will fill you with horrour, and make you run from him as an enemy, and then nothing in the whole creation can releive you. But yet, believingly live upon the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, by him to have all breaches heal'd betwixt God
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63182:82"/>and your Souls, and by his Spirit to have your ſouls heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all their diſtempers. Reſt in nothing as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your intereſt in him, below an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and ſincere endeavour to grow up in him, to bee like to him, and to fulfil all the gracious precepts of his Goſpel: And having this evidence, let no temptations or doubtings rob you of the comfort it may afford. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that as your happineſs conſiſts in communion with God, ſo this is not perfectly to be enjoy'd till after Death and Judgement. Wherefore live alwaies chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, apprehenſive of the certainty and nearneſs, of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death; let your great buſineſs bee to get fitted for it, and let all your main deſigns be ſo laid, that they may not be blaſted, but accompliſh't by it. When once you have done this, you have little more to fear at one time than another, and nothing at any time: For to Death, you are in a manner alwaies alike liable, and this is the worſt that any mortal power can bring upon you, onely they may make it more gainful and honourable than otherwiſe it would. What matter is it, whether we dye amongſt our enemies, or our friends, ſince wee then take our leave of both? Whether upon a bed, or on the ground, ſince our body will ſo ſoon bee in the earth? What matter is't, whether the fire of a Feaver, or of a Faggot conſume us, whether our ſouls fly out at our mouths or our throats, ſince either way they will be alike ſoon with God.</p>
            <p>But Scripture is moſt of all wont to preſs our looking and earneſt waiting for the coming of Chriſt: Perhaps, as having leſs terrour in it to a Believer than death, and as being the time when our fulleſt glory ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht, the whole Body of Chriſt being then brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the preſence of their glorified Head, and to a participation of his Glory. And I'le ſhut up all with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63182:83"/>an earneſt requeſt, that you would comfort and encourage your ſelves with the fore-thoughts of, and ardent long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after, this day of the appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. When ever it is with you, whilſt you are ſailing over this Ocean, as it was with <hi>Pauls</hi> company, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.20. that neither Sun nor Stars in many daies appear, and no ſmall Tempeſt lies on you, then caſt forth the Anchor of Hope, and wiſh for this day. And fix not your hopes with ſteadineſs on any day ſhort of this, or your dying day. The experience we have had of the long-talkt of, and (by ſome) much hop't-for 66. (beſide other warnings of this kind) may tell us, that they who build their faith upon fancie, do but encreaſe their own troubles, provoke others laughter, and dangerouſly tempt themſelves to Infidelitie. Expect this coming of Chriſt, not to the ſame purpoſe that the Jews did, and ſtill do their Meſſiah; to make you rich, and high, and proſperous in the world, to throw down great men, that you may enter upon their places and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, a poor preferment to a true Saint; but expect him to advance you above ſin and Satan, the world and fleſh, and to raiſe you to the cleareſt, bleſſed Viſion, and fruition of your God. Upon this promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing build all your hopes, lay all your ſtreſs, and venture all you have: If this prove falſe, we are all undone, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till then, nor then neither any worſe than the reſt of the world that believed it not; for there's nothing elſe to hold by but what we are ſure will fail us, and if this fail too, Mankind was made to no more purpoſe than Boys blow up a feather. But never fear it; though the Worldling tells you by his practiſe he believes its falſe; though the profane Swaggerer ſay ſo down-right, and prove it by a jeer, as the more ſullen Atheiſt by his unreaſonable cavils and wranglings, yet believe none
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63182:83"/>of them till you have tryed; they neither are, nor poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can be, ſure of the contrarie, whilſt they are in this life; and if there be no other life than this, they'l ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to upbraid you with your weakneſs and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: But if there be (as nothing more ſure) let them look to themſelves: Then let it be ſeen whether the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of ſcraping Earth-worms, the mirth and muſick, the childiſh ſports and bruitiſh delights of ſenſual Gallants, the Drollerie and Sophiſtrie of ſelf-conceited Infidel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, will be as good ſecuritie to them, as your faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even that which they were wont to deride as follie, proceeding from prejudice, melancholly, or ſuperſtition. That will be the trying time, when it ſhall be known who were wiſe men, and who were fools, when a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and all-knowing Judge ſhall juſtly decide the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. Oh Sirs, do you look for ſuch a day as this, ſuch an amazing confounding day, when the whole world ſhall be turned upſide down, the earth become fuel for raging flames, and all its Inhabitants brought to account for their actions, and receive their doom to endleſs joy or woe? And have you any hopes of ſtanding in ſuch a day as this, of beholding our Lord with confidence, when he ſhall appear in all his Majeſty, with thouſands of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for his Honourable Attendants, when the Heavens above ſhall ring with the joyful acclamations of theſe glorious Spirits, and the Saints their Companions, and the Air below ſhall be fill'd with the yellings and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Devils and damned Ghoſts: Do you look, I ſay, ere long to ſee ſuch ſights as theſe, and to partake of the glory and joy of that great day? And will you now be much concern'd for the burning of an houſe or City, or for the buſles and confuſions of this dreaming world, that will not till then be awakened? Oh unreaſonable! that the Saints, who ſhall ſhortly meet their Redeemer with comfort, and before all the world be acquitted and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63182:84"/>applauded, crown'd and receiv'd into eternal joyes, ſhould now paſs their time in ſo much ſolitarineſs, and live no more upon the hopes of ſuch a day. And oh mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous! that ſinners, who muſt ſhortlie be judged and ſhamed before all, and ſentenc't to the ſad Societie of Devils for ever, can yet ſpend their daies in eaſe and pleaſure, in pampering and adorning their dirty fleſh, overwhelm'd with gluttony and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life, as if they were reſolved never to think of their miſerie till they feel it, and judg'd it better to feel it, than to think of it ſo as to prevent it. But let them take their courſe, and ſee where it will end: But all you the unfeigned friends and followers of the bleſſed Jeſus, who ſhall be your Judge, let it be your work to fetch comfort from that which is other mens terrour. <hi>When their hearts fall for fear, you muſt lift up your heads, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Redemption draws nigh.</hi> Or in S. <hi>James</hi> his words, <hi>Be patient, ſtabliſh your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draws nigh.</hi> And nearer it is drawn by ſixteen hundred years ſince theſe words were wrote; How near then may we now think it? Though how near we cannot ſay, yet for certain it's not far off. The eyes of them ſhall not fail that wait for him; he will not fruſtrate your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, as <hi>Siſera</hi> did his Mothers, you who look forth from the priſon windows of the fleſh, and with her cry out, <hi>Why is his Chariot ſo long in coming? Why tarry the wheels of his Chariot?</hi> Confidently dare I anſwer you, yea, you may make anſwer to your ſelves, <hi>Our Lord is coming to gather together and comfort all his diſperſed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ones, from the ſeveral corners of the world; he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give them final and full releaſe from the heavy yoke of Turkiſh, Popiſh, and all other bondage and cruelty that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains till that day; he is coming to trample down and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all oppoſitions to his Government and Scepter, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly to deſtroy the works of the Devil, and all his Adherents;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63182:84"/>he is coming to plead the cauſe of his righteous ſervants, to vindicate them and the honour of Religion from all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful ſcandals, ſlanders, and calumnies, which the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of pretended Friends, or the wilful malice of envenomed Enemies, hath caſt upon them. He's coming to make all faces and actions bare, to reveal the ſecrets of all hearts, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truth from falſhood. He is coming to the confuſion and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of all careleſs and ungodly ones, rich or poor, Princes or People, that thought not on, nor prepar'd for this time; but he comes to the perfect, full, and everlaſting Conſolation of all believing ſouls, that are praying and waiting, looking and longing for this bleſſed day of his appearing. Even ſo, Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly;</hi> and let him that readeth ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
